                    Crown shyness, also canopy 
                    disengagement canopy shyness,or inter-crown spacing is a 
                    phenomenon observed in some tree species, in which the 
                    crowns of fully 
                    stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy 
                    width channel-like gaps. The phenomenon is most prevalent 
                    among trees of the same species, but also occurs between
                    trees of different species There exist many hypotheses as 
                    to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, 
                    and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of 
                    leaf-eating insect larvae.

                <u>Possible Physiological Explanations</u></h3>
                <p>
                    The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is 
                    uncertain. The phenomenon has been discussed 
                    in scientific literature since the 1920s. The variety of 
                    hypotheses and experimental results might suggest 
                    that there are multiple mechanisms across different species, 
                    an example of convergent 
                    evolution.
