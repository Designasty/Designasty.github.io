        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>20 pitted Medjool dates</li>
            <li>2/3 to 3/4 cup hot whole milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>pinch of sea salt, optional</li>
        </ul>
        <br>    
        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Soak the Dates:</b> Place the pitted dates in a bowl and 
                cover them with hot water. Let them soak for about 15-20 
                minutes. This will soften them, making it easier to blend them 
                into a smooth caramel
            </li>  
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Drain the Dates:</b> After soaking, drain the dates of the 
                water. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Blend:</b> Transfer the soaked dates to a blender or food 
                processor. Add the milk, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt 
                if desired. Start blending on low speed and gradually increase 
                to high. Blend until the dates form a smooth and creamy paste. 
                You may need to scrape down the sides of the blender or food 
                processor a few times to ensure everything gets evenly blended.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Adjust Consistency:</b> If the caramel is too thick, add a 
                little bit more milk or water, a tablespoon at a time, and 
                continue blending until you reach your desired consistency. 
                If you prefer a thinner caramel, add more liquid; if you prefer
                it thicker, use less liquid.  
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Taste and Adjust:</b> Once you've achieved the desired 
                consistency, taste the caramel and adjust the sweetness and 
                saltiness as needed. You can add more dates for sweetness or 
                more salt for flavor balance. 
            </li>   
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Serve or Store:</b> Your date caramel is now ready to use! 
                You can use it as a topping for desserts like ice cream, 
                pancakes, or oatmeal, or as a dip for fruit slices. Store any 
                leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up 
                to 1 to 2 weeks.
